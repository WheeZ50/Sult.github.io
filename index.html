to Sult's Bazaar</big></big><br />


<br />


</big>This is the place to browse for "Eve Online" goods.<br />


From ships and drones to modules and structures, more and more items
will become available on this site!<br />


<br />


When you need something and you can wait a couple of hours to get it,
this is the place for you. For us people in Null-Sec items are scarce
and hard to come by. Most of it needs to come from Jita or other places
in High-sec.<br />


Lets change that and make ourselves more self sustained.<br />


<br />


Go ahead and browse around, and see if there are any goods you need.<br />


If you find anything to your liking, please contact me in game and make
sure to get it to you as fast as possible.<br />


<br />


Keep in mind that all prices are negotiable.</p>

<div class="postcontent">
<p><big style="font-style: italic;"><big><big>Something
about myself</big></big></big></p>


<p>I started my Eve career not to long ago in the early spring of
2013. At start it was hard to grasp all the aspects of the game. Using
the famous Internet to get more and more information about eve I
decided that manufacturing was the direction I wanted to go. The idea
was to be able to do everything myself from mining the ore to
producing the products and everything in between. Soon I realized that
that was pretty skill heavy but that didn't hold
me back.<br />


<br />


After some time I found a new corporation and got myself into Null-sec.
Almost immediately I discovered that the market in Null-sec was as good
as dried up. Everything got imported from Jita or other places in
High-sec. So here I found my mission: "Lets get this market flowering
as well."<br />


Together with my corporation members we should be able to offer a lot
of items here a swell, for a fair price.<br />


<br />


Here I ran into a problem, my skills in manufacturing are not high
enough to produce the items most needed. And my market skills are even
way worse, so I decided to build this site. This way I can manufacture
better towards your needs and against a cheaper price, since I don't
need to build useless goods hoping they get sold.<br />


<br />


Please lets help each other out and take matters in our own hands. Let
our territory flourish and show our neighbors what we can do.<br />


<br />


With kind regards,<br />


Sult Dizarra<br />


<br />


<br />


PS. &nbsp;Please keep in mind that this is a temporary site while I
work on the real site. I don't want to give to much details yet because
it is in an early stage. But I think a lot of you will like it, and
make our live easier in Eve.<br />
